# PatatapClone
A Patatap-like website which plays short sounds and displays 2D animated balls on every keypress.

Hosted here: https://dazzling-noyce-252211.netlify.com/

Paperscript is written inside of index.html.

It generates a circle on every keypress with a color defined in keyData using Paper.js. It also plays the sounds defined in keyData using Howler.js

# What I Learned
In this project I learned how to interact with HTML canvases, and more specifically, how to use Paperscript to do so. I also learned how to play sound through modern web browsers with the Howler.js library. This was a fun project that was really valuable in my journey to learn front-end JavaScript.
